# Prompts to regenerate the codes for "deep dive into the process of debugging llms with tools calls"


## Steps:
1. I am building a robust backend server (with NodeJS) and I want to practice looking under the hood of LLMs and how they interact with tools. My goal is to demistify the debugging process with some simple code and something that clearly shows how an LLM function calling can go wrong. give me a starter for building a nodejs based fetch of the openai api where i want to use the function calling to grab news from the news api. Make sure to provide clean code in separate files and then import tools and functions into the server file to call the api. This fetch should be used to call openai api and the news api as a tool or function. Make sure to consider the proper ES module imports and exports. and the type be set to module in the package.json. Add proper logging on the server side to see the requests and responses.

2. Now I want you to add the apify google maps scraper as another tool to the existing code. Make sure to update the function calling structure and consider proper handling of the function calls and the results should be structured in a JSON output taylored for the openai api message list formation.
